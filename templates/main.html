			My name is Ariel. I started my business in February of 2014 and have quit my day job since.
			I do this full time and for the most part, it's just little ol' me.
			I answer all emails, bake, decorate, and package all the treats that go out of my family's home.
			I look forward to opening my door to greet you with your order soon.
